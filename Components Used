Components Used and their functions:-

1) Bluetooth Module(HC-05)
   It is designed for transparent wireless serial connection setup. Its communication is via serial communication
   which makes an easy way to interface with controller or PC. HC-05 Bluetooth module provides switching mode 
   between master and slave mode which means it able to use neither receiving nor transmitting data. 


2) Microcontroller(ATmega328p)
   ATMEGA328P is high performance, low power controller from Microchip. ATMEGA328P is an 8-bit microcontroller based
   on AVR RISC architecture. It is the most popular of all AVR controllers


3) Breadboard
   A breadboard is used to build and test circuits quickly before finalizing any circuit design.

4) Jumping Wires
   A jump wire (also known as jumper wire, or jumper) is an electrical wire, or group of them in a cable, with a connector 
   or pin at each end (or sometimes without them – simply "tinned"), which is normally used to interconnect the components
   of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other equipment or components, without soldering.

4) Led
   A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons
   in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons.

5) Relay
   The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms, such as make contacts, break contacts, or combinations
   thereof. Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by an independent low-power signal, or where several circuits
   must be controlled by one signal.

6) Color Changing app
   This APP is used  to remote control RGB LED on the Microcontroller Atmega328p through Bluetooth Module HC-05 module.
