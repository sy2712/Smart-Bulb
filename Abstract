What is SMART BULB???

Smart Bulbs are lighting devices that are used to establish a particular feeling or mood within a room.
In some cases, this type of lamp may be a small device that is plugged into an outlet and creates points
of light near the floor line of the room. Other examples of a smart bulb may be used to illuminate
specific points along the walls or cast a soft light over a larger piece of furniture in the room.
Smart Bulb differ somewhat from other lamps in that their purpose is not so much practical as aesthetic.
Reading lamps for example tend to provide bright light to a given space in order to make it possible to
read a book or magazine without creating strain on the eyes. Overhead lighting is used when there is a need 
to illuminate the majority of the space, such as in a classroom or laboratory. By contrast, a mood lamp is used
to help create a specific ambiance within the room as a means of making the space more attractive and welcoming in some manner.
