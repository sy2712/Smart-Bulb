Technical Specification:-

• A Smartphone which have android app installed in it.
• Bluetooth Module-  System will be connected to smartphone using Bluetooth technology.
• Controller or Main processing unit- This model is controlled or processed by ATmega328p. 
  Also this model can be controlled via other microcontroller’s like PIC18F4550 ,Arduino UNO, 8051 series.
• Relay- It is used to control devices.



Working Principle:-

• As we all know smart bulbs aren’t standalone device. So this bulb is controlled by an app and to
  control the bulb’s colours and brightness we need to install the an app, then we will connect it 
  by Bluetooth for which we are using HC-05. after the installation and connection part been done.
• In case of controlling colour, as soon as we choose the colour from the app it will send the signal
  to the controller and at the controller side we did the coding so that it will change the colour of 
  the leds accordingly.
• With the help of this app we can turn on and off the bulb as we press the button a signal will go and
  at the controller side this job will be done by relay. 
• The bulb can also be controlled by the presence of the human motion. As soon as the sensor detects the
  motion is been done it will automatically light up the room for the limited amount of time with the pre-recorded
  colour values, this is another way of controlling the bulb.
